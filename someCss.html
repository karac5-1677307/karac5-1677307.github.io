    <h1>Paragraph in Font 1</h1>
    <p class="a"</p>This is my paragraph in the first font. This font is arial in size 15. This is one of my favorite fonts because it reminds me of my handwriting. I would say that this is my most frequently used font for that reason. I like the simplicity and beauty of it. </p>

    <h1>Paragraph in Front 2</h1>
    <p class="b">This is my second paragraph in a different font. This lettering is italized and bold and is in the font Georgia. I have always loved the font Georgia because of its name because used to live in Georgia.The font is very distinct and stands out.</p>
